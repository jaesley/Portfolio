When I ran bookstores, I always imagined myself living in a book. I just didn't realize that
book would be Cracking the Coding Interview. My life as a web developer started with
mastering Excel and Mediawiki for building better tabletop games; now my hobbies include
creating web apps to nd
me new book releases and lobbying Spotify to bring back artist
location in their API. When I'm not coding, you can nd
me touring all Seattle's dog parks and
concert venues. I'll be the one on the front row.
